Tom, this all sounds great. I'm not worried about a commit history but I
would just like you to upload changes to a branch that isn't master, use
whatever name makes sense.

I will select pictures, you can use placeholders for now. Just let me know
when you've pushed something I can look at.

Those three files are correct, note that resources.html is using vue.js to
render the HTML, it should be pretty straightforward but let me know if you
run into any issues. You can reach me on slack with any questions.

Thanks for taking this on!
